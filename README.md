# Wordometer

This project contains certain operations:
1) The Autocomplete feature is used for the prediction of a particular word by taking one
or two letters to make a complete word. It increases the time efficiency and decreases
the buffer time of human-computer interactions by predicting the words that the user
intends to enter after a few initial characters of the desired word are input.
2) It also helps in decreasing the number of keystrokes needed to complete a word.
Implementation using Trie increases the efficiency of the user by at least 10%.
3) In the Search feature, the user enters the word which is to be fetched from the userâ€™s
personalized dictionary.
4) The Insert feature accepts the new word from the user and updates the user&#39;s
personalized dictionary.
5) The Spellchecker suggests the correct spelling of the word entered by the user.
6) Finally, Deletion of the selected word from the dictionary can be performed.
